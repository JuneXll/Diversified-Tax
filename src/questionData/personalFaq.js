        question: `What about filing late, paying penalties, or an extension?`,
        answer: `Best thing to do if you're late is to pay and file your tax return as soon as possible. If you fail to file your tax return by the deadline, you could face a 5% penalty of your unpaid tax bill, plus interest, for each month the return is late - until the penalty hits 25 percent of what you owe.
        If you file but fail to pay your taxes, the penalty is only half a percent of your unpaid tax bill, plus interest, each month.
        
        We understand that collecting all your tax documents can be time-consuming and complicated. If it helps, one of our Pros will file an extension and when you're ready, they'll file your return for you. In order to have an extension filed on your behalf, you must first submit through the platform. Our Pro's are instructed to prepare and file your return before the original deadline. However, if this isn't possible, your return will be extended at no additional cost. `

        question: `What if I can't afford to pay my tax liability?`,
        answer: `As long as you owe $50,000 or less and have already filed your return, you may apply for an installment plan with the IRS. 
        If you owe more than $50,000 but less than $100,000, you may apply for a short-term agreement, but note the following: You must pay higher installments, the IRS will require proof of your financial situation, a mandatory tax lien will apply on your property and your Credit report may take a hit.`
